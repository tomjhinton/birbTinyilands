# birbTinyilands

-- Real mixed bag of a week. 
-- R3F again, still unsure I like it, does still feel less like a creative tool than.
-- Fully aware that is not the traditional spelling of island. 
-- Will not admit how long it took me to become fully aware I'd done it.

***

-- Made a litlle boat in blender.
-- Made a tree in blender.
-- Reused a rock from some other week because this aint geology club, rocks a rock. 

***

-- Little shader to make the water, quite like how it turned out even if every simple.
-- Have no explanation for the particles other than I had been playing with particles.
-- Fireflies? Some unknown iland phenomena. 
-- Shader on the sails in the traditonal colours of the region. 

***

-- The islands/ilands are in fact my least favourite part. 
-- Sqaushed cylinder for the shape.
-- The UVS they gave meant a pain to add a nice shader pattern on them.
-- Therefore theres not a nice pattern on them.
-- Minimal randomisation on tree and rock stuff.

***

-- Thought it would be cute to make the boat move. 
-- It would've been cute if I managed it properly.
-- Let's pretend the region has strong and confusing currents and tides. 
-- Or weird wind, I mean look at those strange things blowing everywhere. 
-- [React-Three-Rapier](https://react-three-rapier.pmnd.rs/) for the physics.
-- I'd forgotten how much the maths for working out where the front of a mesh is confuses me.
-- I'm aware not confusing for many of you. 
-- Found it funny to add jump controls.
-- Found it funny / was too lazy to add in the stuff to stop someone jumping in the air.
